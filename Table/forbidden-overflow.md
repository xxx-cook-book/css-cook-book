# Forbidden Overflow 

```css
.table-layout {
  table-layout: fixed;
  word-break: break-all;
  word-wrap: break-word;
}
```

## word-break

The *word-break* CSS property is used to specify whether to break lines within words.

## overflow-wrap

The *overflow-wrap* property is used to specify whether or not the browser may break lines within words in order to prevent overflow when an otherwise unbreakable string is too long to fit in its containing box.

```
Note: Originally a Microsoft (unprefixed) proprietary extension called word-wrap, and implemented by most browsers, it has been renamed to overflow-wrap. The original name word-wrap is now considered an "alternate name" for overflow-wrap.
